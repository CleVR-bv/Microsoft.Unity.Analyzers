# USP0022 Prefer reference equality

We have a dedicated diagnostic `UNT0029` to prevent is-null check with `UnityEngine.Object`. But `IDE0270` will suggest to use is-null check over reference equality method.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0270 - Null check can be simplified (if null check)

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public void M()
	{
		Camera item = FindItem() as Camera;
		if (item == null)
			throw new System.InvalidOperationException();
	}

	MonoBehaviour FindItem() => null;
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Under normal circumstances, `if (item == null) throw new System.InvalidOperationException()` can be simplified to `Camera item = FindItem() as Camera ?? throw new System.InvalidOperationException();`.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Unity has overridden the `==` operator for `UnityEngine.Object`. If you use the `==` operator to compare a `UnityEngine.Object` to null, it will return true if the `UnityEngine.Object` is destroyed, even if the object itself isn't actually null. The `??` operator cannot be overridden in this way, and therefore behaves inconsistently with the `==` operator, because it checks for null in a different way.
